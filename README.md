# Piscine-01

This repository contains all the exercises I completed during my one-month piscine at Zone01 Oujda.

## Overview

The piscine is an intensive coding bootcamp that covers fundamental programming concepts through practical exercises. This repository contains my solutions to the various assignments completed during this period.

## Contents

- **Shell Projects**: Command-line exercises and scripts
- **Golang Projects**: Various exercises and projects implemented in Go

## Shell

The Shell portion of the piscine focused on Unix/Linux command line operations, shell scripting, and understanding the terminal environment.

## Golang

The majority of the piscine was dedicated to learning the Go programming language, covering topics such as:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Arrays, slices, and maps
- Structs and pointers
- Error handling
- File I/O
- Basic algorithms and problem-solving

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by project/exercise, with each directory containing the relevant code files and resources.

## What I Learned

During this intensive one-month piscine at Zone01 Oujda, I gained:

- Proficiency in Go programming
- Shell scripting skills
- Problem-solving abilities
- Experience with algorithm implementation
- Familiarity with Git and version control
- Ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and solutions. Each directory typically contains the exercise specifications and my implementation.
